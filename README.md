# Tree Search Controller
This project consists of three main sections, all written from scratch: A basic physics simulator with collision resolution, a tree search - based path planner, and a graphics generator for display and debugging.

## Physics
The world in this simulation consists of a 2D map with walls and obstacles. There are two triangular robot actors, with the ability to turn and move forward.
